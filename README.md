Socket programming tutorials on <a href="http://www.binarytides.com/">Binarytides</a>.

Socket programming involves writing programs or applications that are able to talk to other computers or machine over a network
like LAN or internet. Browsers like google chrome, firefox, chat applications like pidgin, skype are all examples of applications
that use sockets.

At binarytides.com I have written a couple of tutorials on how to program sockets in various languages like C, python, perl and java
check them out
